# Employee Directory
 ### Project 5, Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript TechDegree Program

Attention Treehouse: Extra Credit features included:
- prev/next buttons added to the modal dialog
- search box added to the main page
- prev/next logic rewritten to take only displayed elements into consideration when a search is in progress
- eye candy applied using CSS gradients, transitions and transforms

This project uses the JavaScript Fetch interface to retrieve employee data from an external web site without having to load a new page. Clicking on an employee card generates a modal version of the card containing more information along with navigation buttons. The search box dynamically hides any cards that do not match the search string. We check name, email address and location for a match.
