# Employee Directory via Public API Request
 ## Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree Unit 5

This project was graded **Exceeds Expectations**.

This project uses the JavaScript Fetch interface to retrieve employee data from an external web site without having to load a new page. Clicking on an employee card generates a modal version of the card containing more information along with navigation buttons. The search box dynamically hides any cards that do not match the search string. We check name, email address and location for a match.
